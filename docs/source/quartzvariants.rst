Quartz Variants
=====

.. _darkenedquartz:

Darkened Quartz
------------

Darkened Quartz can be found throughout the Nether, being about double as rare as Nether Quartz Ore. Without Silk Touch, Darkened Nether Quartz Ore can drop up to 1-3 Darkened Quartz. This can be crafted into different block variants as well as combined with Quartzian Armor to make Darkened Quartzian Armor.

.. _quartzidianite:

Quartzidianite
----------------

Quartzidianite can be found wherever Obsidian can be found naturally. (I'm not sure if it fully works yet.) I plan to make it craftable into Quartzidianite tools/armor in the same fashion as Netherite, by using Diamond Armor in a Smithing Table.
